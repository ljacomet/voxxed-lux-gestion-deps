== Aligning a group of dependencies

=== What is the problem?

* A group of dependencies are designed to work together.
** Think `jackson` or even the Spring framework
* Through transitive dependency updates, modules end up having different versions

So the goal would be to have the tools to make sure that _any_ upgrade of _any_ module would cause the whole set to upgrade its version.

=== Demo

=== Virtual platforms for published libraries

[%step]
* Name a virtual platform module
* Enhance library modules metadata to reference that platform
* Each added module is also made part of the virtual platform
** When `jackson-dataformat-yaml` says it belongs to the platform, all platform _versions_ now point to it as well
* Alignment!

=== Details, details

[%step]
* A virtual platform can only align to a version it sees in the graph
* A virtual platform will _attempt_ alignment on all modules
** I a module `X` does not exist in version `B`, lower known versions will be tried in decreasing order

=== Can I leverage an existing BOM?

[%step]
* Yes, but:
* You still need the `belongsTo`
* Alignment will be according to the BOM definitions

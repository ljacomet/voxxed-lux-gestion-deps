== Why dependency management?

=== A long time ago ...

[source,bash]
----
> javac -d out *.java
> cd out/
> jar cf ../../lib/project1.jar *.class
> cd ../../project2
> javac -cp ../lib/project1.jar -d out *.class
----

=== Then came tools

* Helped you build and package
* Did not handle dependencies
** Download jars from project website
** Lived in a `lib` directory or equivalent
** Often saved next to code in source control

=== Growing ecosystem

With the growing popularity of Java and the growth of its ecosystem,
managing all dependencies of a project turns into a dependency chase.

=== Thus dependency management ...

* Ivy or Maven would take care of your dependencies
** Libraries have known coordinates
** Published to repositories, with metadata in addition of the binary
** Automated the transitive aspect of dependency management

=== And Gradle joins the party

* Compatible with all of the previous options
** `lib` or custom repositories
** Ivy metadata
** Maven metadata
** Gradle Module Metadata (https://blog.gradle.org/gradle-metadata-1.0[since 5.3])
** and more ...
